        text="On September 8th, 2023 I went to the First Look Fair with my friend. It was very hot that day, but I wanted to check out everything, so that's what I did for almost two hours. My main goal was to find computer science clubs, but on the way to the computer science clubs, I found some non-computer science clubs that caught my eye.  The first of these clubs were Badminton clubs because there are always courts to play on, compared to the very busy Eppley Recreation Center. I found the Asian Interests clubs and the ones I probably will end up going to are TASA, VSA, and CSA. They all seem like a great way to meet new people who share a common identity with me. I found some clubs that sound interesting to me, but I donâ€™t think I will join them such as Survivor, based on the actual show, and UMCP Gaming. UMCP Gaming surprised me with how many members they have and what they do such as hosting LAN events. Toward the end of my trip, I found Computer Science related clubs and programs that I found interesting in actually doing. Sprinternship which is a micro internship program that works with actual companies, Bitcamp which is an annual hackathon at UMD, and App Build Dev club where people code projects for actual companies. Overall the First Look Fair revealed to me how there is actually to do on Campus. I got a good understanding that there is a club for virtually anything and that one can find someone or a group of people with common interests as long as they are willing to put themselves out there.

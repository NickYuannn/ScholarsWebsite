        text="I went to the pumpkin painting that was led by the peer mentors. It was a very fun time for me. Art, I admit is not one of my strong suits, but with the collaboration of friends I made in Media scholars, we made a pretty product. It was a pretty good environment, there was food, there was music, friendly people, and crafts. I have not had Ledo’s in a long time, so I was excited to try Ledo’s again and the music was nice as it matched the theme of the event and Halloween in general. 

It was a good way to relax a bit as it was almost the weekend. Besides trying to match the sketch of the woman, which I was very proud of the results, my group and I drew whatever we wanted to and gave each other ideas. I remember drawing a door and a sheep because that was what someone suggested. Spinning the pumpkin, you could find Spongebob, Batman, and faces with various emotions. 

Overall the pumpkin painting event was very enjoyable. I got to have fun with my group of friends that I made recently and bond with something nonstressful. "
